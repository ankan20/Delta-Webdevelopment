        [http -> text based] 
        Express convert that into Object

    let diceVal = Math.floor(Math.random()*6) +1;
    res.render("rolldice.ejs",{
        diceVal 
    });
})
    We can pass 2nd argument as a object which we get from database and it is a object but we use key :value as same name so we can pass only one thing as name and we can use that in our ejs file

    public - name folder
